# CalculatorSwiftUI
Hey Everyone ! üñê
this is a basic calculator made for iOS 15 in SwiftUI. everything should work on iOS 14 but the design would not be the same.
you basicly change the main color of the calculator with the color picker and since the button have .background(.thinMaterials) they should slightly adapt to the color. i don't recommend using colors that are too light since you'll lose the contrast.
this code is made with the xcode 13 beta so you should open it with the beta or with the official release if you are from the future.
it's fun short project i made while watching dubdub 21 videos. hope the code might be usefull to someone.

the layout should adapt for iPhone and iPad, try it out üôå
